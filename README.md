# based
A simple python3 tool for creating a complete solution to the tasks of converting decimal to binary and vice versa
_ _ _
To use just run `python3 base.py`

But also you can pre-insert the values by running `python3 base.py {2 or 10} {value}`
_ _ _
If you need only to convert without cool "solution string" then just use:

decimal to binary: `f"{decimal:d}"`

binary to decimal: `int(binary, 2)`
